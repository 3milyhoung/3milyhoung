## Hey! 😁

My name is Emily, and I'm currently working on creating a portfolio for the duration of the KKCF program. Additionally, I plan to dual major in Management Information Systems and Design upon entering college. I love to draw, paint, and create crafts. I enjoy using Figma to create visuals for logos, websites, etc. My pronouns are She/Her, and I'm a 2nd generation Asian American.
